FUNDING:
	SAGE GUI development was supported by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research institute
	through funding from The David and Lucile Packard Foundation, by the National Science Foundation,
	Division of Polar Programs (NSF PLR -1425989), supplemented by NOAA and NASA, as well as
	funding from NSF grant 0825348, National Ocean Partnership Program grant N00014 09 10052
	and NOAA grant NA17RJ1232, part 2 to the University of Washington.
	
AUTHORS USING SOCCOM FLOAT DATA SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE:
	Data were collected and made freely available by the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM) Project 
	funded by the National Science Foundation, Division of Polar Programs (NSF PLR -1425989), supplemented by NASA, and by the 
	International Argo Program and the NOAA programs that contribute to it. (http://www.argo.ucsd.edu(link is external), http://argo.jcommops.org(link is external)). 
	The Argo Program is part of the Global Ocean Observing System."

DATA / MATLAB FUNCTIONS:
	Profiling float data were collected and made freely available by the Southern Ocean Carbon
	and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM) Project and by the University of Washington.
	Freely available comparison data sets were generously supplied or estimated from multiple sources:
	
	Shipboard data from CCHDO (https://cchdo.ucsd.edu/search?q=SOCCOM) and NCEI (https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/ocads/oceans/SOCCOM/SOCCOM.html).  
	Special thanks to staff and crew of SOCCOM cruise ships (details listed at http://soccom.ucsd.edu/data/SOCCOM_ancdata.html) for their efforts in 
	shipboard data collection, as well as SOCCOM float deployments!

	Multiple Linear regression estimations of nitrate and pH (Williams et. al., 2016)
	
	LIRs: a family of functions which estimate various seawater properties based on Locally Interpolated multiple linear Regressions:
		LIAR: locally interpolated multiple Linear regression estimation of alkalinity (Carter et al., 2016, doi: 10.1002/lom3.10087)
		LINR and LIPHR: locally interplolated multiple Linear regression estimations of nitrate and pH (Carter et al. 2017?, in prep)
		
		NOTE: LINR and LIPHR are still in the beta testing stage and the results may be subject to change. LIAR, LINR and LIPHR
		all rely on the GLODAPV2 data set for training the regressions. GLODAPV2 is expected to be updated annually which
		may allow for annual updates of the regression coefficient data sets and therefore changes to the estimates. Once LINR
		and LIPHR pass beta testing "beta" will be replaced by the version # in the GUI interface.
